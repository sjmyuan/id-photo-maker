# Steps to identify bug root cause 

- Gather relevant information from the codebase, knowledge base, test results and user input to clearly identify the bug.
- Analyze the information to identify patterns, inconsistencies, or anomalies that may indicate the root cause of the bug.
- Formulate hypotheses about potential causes and systematically test them through code inspection, debugging, or additional logging.
- Ask questions to the user to narrow down the possibilities until the most likely root cause is identified.
- Present the identified root cause and the reasoning process to the user and request confirmation or refinements.
